The most direct way to attack a stone wall or other stone fortification was to knock it down with a battering ram. A typical ram was a stout log mounted on wheels or suspended from a frame so it could swing forward and backward. The frame was brought up to the wall or gate to be battered; men heaving in unison then repeatedly slammed the ram into the target. Given enough time, any obstruction could be knocked down, opening a breach for assault.
