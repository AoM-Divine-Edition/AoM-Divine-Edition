Religion had central importance in the Aztec Empire since it was not only closely linked with the expansion and power of the empire but also legitimised the rule of the kings. The priests performed various rituals and prayers during the religious festivals and ceremonies. These ceremonies were performed at the end of the each Aztec month which consisted of twenty days. The most important aspect of these religious ceremonies performed by Aztec priests was the human sacrifices for which prisoners of war were used.

The two most powerful priests are the Quetzalcoatl-Totec Tlamacazqui and Quetzalcoatl-Tlaloc Tlamacazqui. The first represented the patron god of the city Huitzilopochtli and the second represented Tlaloc, the rain god. They were the priests in charge of the sanctuary of the god who they represent. The sanctuary of Huitzilopochtli and Tlaloc were the only sanctuaries on the highest pyramid of the great temple signifying the great devotion of the Aztecs to both of these gods.
