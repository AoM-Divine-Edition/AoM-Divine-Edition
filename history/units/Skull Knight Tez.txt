In Aztec society, membership in the calpulli established each individual's religious and secular schooling, as well as how they would be trained in warfare. The men of a calpulli served together in battle and on the numerous public works projects. Their soldiers wielded weapons of wood and stone, and they often sought prisoners to be sacrificed in religious ceremonies.

The most-feared and powerful division in the Aztec army was made up of skull knights. Their name, Tzitzimitl, translates as "frightful specters," the skull knight dressed as a kind of undead horror, and the enemy often fled at their advance.
