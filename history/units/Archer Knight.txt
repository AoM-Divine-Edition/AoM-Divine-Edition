The Aztec Empire incorporated many neighboring Mesoamerican cultures in a complex mix of trade and tribute. Warriors from neighboring tribes were often called to duty by the Aztec as they expanded throughout the region.

The arrow knights, not Aztec by birth, were allies or subject peoples called into service. Their primary weapon was the atlatl, a leverage device that enabled its user to accurately hurl a spear up to 150 yards.
