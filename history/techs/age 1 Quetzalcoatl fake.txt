Quetzalcoatl was a god of wisdom and creation. He defeated his duplicitous brother Tezcatlipoca, and ruled over the second sun, until it was destroyed by hurricanes. 
During the creation of the fifth sun, Quetzalcoatl descended into the underworld to recover the bones of the previous generation of humans. The ruler of the underworld, Mictlantecuhtli attempted to stop Quetzalcoatl, but he escaped the underworld with the human bones, and reached the heavenly plane of Tamoanchan. He used his blood to revive humanity, and ruled over the kingdom of Tollan, until Tezcatlipoca got him drunk and forced him into an exile.
Quetzalcoatl walked across the land and passed through multiple towns performing miracles, when he reached the end of his journey he ascended to the sky and became the morning star.
