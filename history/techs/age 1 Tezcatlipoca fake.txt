The god of the night sky and sorcery, his name meant the Smoking Mirror. Tezcatlipoca and his brother Quetzalcoatl created the world from the body of the monstrous crocodile Cipactli. This era was known as the first sun, and the earth was inhabited by a race of giants. Tezcatlipoca ruled over the first sun, until Quetzalcoatl attacked him out of jealousy and send him down to earth. The darkness blanketed the earth, and all the giants died out during the ensuing battle. Tezcatlipoca then became a god of conflict, hostility, and discord.
Other gods took turns in rulership, but in each era, Tezcatlipoca used trickery and deceit to end their reign. 
Tonatiuh rules over the fifth and the current sun. Tezcatlipoca watches his rule with greed and envy. Should the humans displease Tezcatlipoca yet again, the darkness will cover the sun, the monstrous star demons will descend upon the world and annihilate all its inhabitants.
