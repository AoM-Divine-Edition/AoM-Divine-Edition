In R'lyeh, the temples were known to issue forth bursts of lightning that could lay a hundred men low in a moment. They were covered in horrible images and disturbing hieroglyphs, with geometries unfit for this earth, making them a sight to inspire madness in all who gazed upon them.

"[T]he nightmare corpse-city of R'lyeh [...] was built in measureless eons behind history by the vast, loathsome shapes that seeped down from the dark stars. There lay great Cthulhu and his hordes, hidden in green slimy vaults [...] until the end."
