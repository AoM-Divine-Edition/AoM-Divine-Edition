His name meant "Cloud Serpent”; he was the God of the Milky Way.
Mixcoatl invented the fire by revolving the heavens around their axes, bringing fire to humanity. Along with this cosmic fire, Mixcoatl was the first to strike fire with flint. These events made Mixcoatl a god of the Milky Way, along with war, and the hunt.
Mixcoatl was the father of 400 sons, collectively known as the Centzon Huitznahua, (the southern stars) who ended up having their hearts eaten by Huitzilopochtli. Mixcoatl was also thought of as being the father of another important deity, Quetzalcoatl, the feathered serpent.
