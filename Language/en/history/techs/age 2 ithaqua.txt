Ithaqua is a Great Old One who inhabits the northern reaches of Asia and North America, ranging from Siberia to Canada to even the forests of New England in pre-colonial times. 

He is widely feared and despised, as Ithaqua is most well-known for hunting travelers and evicerating them, or abducting them to Borea before hurling them into the winds where they fall to their deaths. 

His children are wendigo, but not the wendigo of Native American myth -- these wendigo, though often confused for the spiritual variety, are flesh-and-blood servitors, lesser images of Ithaqua who inevitably grow to hate and betray him.

"Cold...my blood was as ice, my wounds bled no more...I would stop my ears, put out my eyes, but for the piercing wail, the voice, no, voices on the wind that filled my soul with the indubitable knowledge that I was so pitiably alone."
