The King in Yellow is a hideous play, the reading of which invites Hastur, the King in Yellow himself, into the life of the reader, and the production of which can lead to disaster. In some cases, mere outbreaks of madness, but in others, mass murder.

In this case, The King in Yellow is performed in full in its original translation, and none who view its closing chapter stand a hope of survival.

"When the French government seized the translated copies which had just arrived in Paris, London, of course, became eager to read it. It is well known how the book spread like an infectious disease, from city to city, from continent to continent, barred out here, confiscated there, denounced by press and pulpit, censured even by the most advanced of literary anarchists. No definite principles had been violated in those wicked pages, no doctrine promulgated, no convictions outraged. It could not be judged by any known standard, yet, although it was acknowledged that the supreme note of art had been struck in The King in Yellow, all felt that human nature could not bear the strain nor thrive on words in which the essence of purest poison lurked. The very banality and innocence of the first act only allowed the blow to fall afterwards with more awful effect."
