The silk of the Daughters of Atlach-Nacha is supernaturally strong, able to bind the flesh of those who wear it and staunch bleeding. 

"The process of transformation begins with the human shedding their skin, which in turn forms a sack-like cocoon around it. Within this "egg sack", the rebirthed human's flesh peels away while their body mutates into a massive, spider-like creature. Within a few hours, the transformed daughter breaks free of the cocoon, ready to undertake Atlach-Nacha's bidding."
