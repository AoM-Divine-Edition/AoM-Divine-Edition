Quetzalcoatl had long admired the beautiful music that was kept in the palace of the sun, and he longed to share it with the people of the earth. One day, he decided to take action and steal the music himself.

Quetzalcoatl ran as fast as the wind, using his powers to avoid detection by the sun god and his guards. He was so fast that he was able to reach the ground with the music before the sun god even realized it was missing.

Once Quetzalcoatl had brought the music to earth, he gifted it to mankind, sharing its beauty and power with all who would listen. The people were overjoyed to receive such a wonderful gift, and they praised Quetzalcoatl for his bravery and generosity.
