With systematic violations of the highest order, the Yith-Possessed can be produced far, far more efficiently. These breeding programs are brutal things, involving monstrous deeds with manifestations of the Great Race of Yith themselves, and offer the resulting children a stronger will against the creatures of the dark.

"When these things had come to the earth they had built mighty basalt cities of windowless towers, and had preyed horribly upon the beings they found. Thus it was when the minds of the Great Race sped across the void from that obscure trans-galactic world known in the disturbing and debatable Eltdown Shards as Yith. The newcomers, with the instruments they created, had found it easy to subdue the predatory entities and drive them down to those caverns of inner earth which they had already joined to their abodes and begun to inhabit. Then they had sealed the entrances and left them to their fate, afterward occupying most of their great cities and preserving certain important buildings for reasons connected more with superstition than with indifference, boldness, or scientific and historical zeal."
