Xipe Totec was particularly associated with the planting and harvesting of maize, which was a staple crop for the Aztec people. He was believed to oversee the growth and ripening of the maize crops, and his worship was an important part of the agricultural calendar.

In addition to his role in agriculture, Xipe Totec was also associated with the practice of human sacrifice. It was believed that by sacrificing captives and flaying their skin, the god would be appeased and would grant a bountiful harvest in return.

Overall, Xipe Totec represented the cyclical nature of life, death, and rebirth that was so central to Aztec beliefs. His association with spring and renewal was a reminder of the constant cycles of growth and regeneration that were necessary for the survival of the people and their crops.
