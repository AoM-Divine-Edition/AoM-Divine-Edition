The story goes that Xolotl, a god in Aztec mythology, had a special tree on Earth that grew cacao beans in its pods. He believed that only the gods were worthy of eating this fruit, so he would go to the tree every morning to enjoy it in secret. Xolotl made sure never to open the pods in front of humans, who lived nearby. He kept this ritual to himself, enjoying the cacao beans in solitude. But Quetzalcoatl thought that such a delicious fruit should not be kept from the people.

Cacao beans were a valuable commodity in the Aztec Empire and were used as currency. The beans were used to pay taxes, buy goods and services, and even to pay wages to workers.
