In Aztec mythology, the journey of the dead to the underworld was a long and perilous one. According to Aztec beliefs, after a person died, their soul would embark on a four-year journey through a number of different underworlds before reaching their final resting place in Mictlan.

The 7th obstacle the soul would encounter on this journey was the Xochitonal, a fearsome underworld iguana.
