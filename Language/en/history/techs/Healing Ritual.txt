The Aztecs had a complex system of healing that included a variety of rituals and ceremonies. A typical healing ceremony involved the use of herbs, chanting, and offerings to the gods.

The first step in an Aztec healing ceremony was to diagnose the illness or problem. The healer, would consult with the patient and examine them to determine the cause of their ailment. Once the problem was identified, the healer would prepare a healing mixture of herbs and other ingredients, such as honey or animal fat, and administer it to the patient.
