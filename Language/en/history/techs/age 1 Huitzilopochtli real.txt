A deity of war, sun, and the patron of the city of Tenochtitlan. He wielded the fire serpent, Xiuhcoatl.
The earth goddess Coatlicue became impregnated with Huitzilopochtli by a ball of feathers on Mount Coatepec. Her other children were the four hundred Southern Stars and the female lunar deity Coyolxauhqui. These children, angered by how their mother became impregnated, conspired to kill her. During the attack, Huitzilopochtli burst forth from his mother's womb in full armor and fully grown. He attacked his older brothers and sister, defending his mother by beheading his sister and casting her body from the mountain top. He also chased after his brothers, who fled from him and became scattered all over the sky.
In later Aztec cosmology Coatlicue represents the Earth while Huitzilopochtli is seen as the sun, and his many male siblings are perceived as the stars and his sister as the moon.
