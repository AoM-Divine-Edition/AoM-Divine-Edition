How many eyes does Yog-Sothoth have? Ten thousand more, and one.  Those who follow in the path set may peer through reality itself, casting their gaze upon the earth in any location they deem fit.

Of course, for such eyegates of inhuman origin, they remain motionless, fixated upon the world which they see and carless of the world beyond their eyesight.  

Why should an enemy ever escape your sight?  Do they deserve to hide in the shadows?  Shouldn't you know every move they make?  See what they know, know what they see.

"Past, present, future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth. He knows where the Old Ones broke through of old, and where They shall break through again. He knows where They have trod earth's fields, and where They still tread them, and why no one can behold Them as They tread."
