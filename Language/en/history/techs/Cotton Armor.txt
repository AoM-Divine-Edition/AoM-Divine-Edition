The ichcahuipilli was a type of soft body armor used by the Aztecs and Tlaxcalans during battle. It was made by layering densely packed cotton between two pieces of fabric. In Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, the name ichcahuipilli comes from the words "ichcatl" meaning cotton and "huīpīlli" meaning shirt.
