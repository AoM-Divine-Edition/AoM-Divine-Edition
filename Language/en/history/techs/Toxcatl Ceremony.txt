The Toxcatl ceremony was an important religious festival in Aztec culture that was held annually in the month of May. The festival was dedicated to the god Tezcatlipoca, who was one of the major deities in the Aztec pantheon. The ceremony was centered around the sacrifice of a young man who had been impersonating Tezcatlipoca since the last Toxcatl festival, and the selection of a new man to take that role in the year to come.

The young man who had been impersonating Tezcatlipoca, known as the ixiptla, was typically a war captive who had been trained specifically for this role. He was treated with great honor and respect throughout the year, but his ultimate fate was to be sacrificed during the Toxcatl festival. The ceremony was believed to ensure the continued prosperity and protection of the Aztec people.
