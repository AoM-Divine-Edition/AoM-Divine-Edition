The bloated statues of Tsathoggua adorn nearly all of the god's strongholds.  Be they Atlantians, ruled by Klarkash-Ton, or be they the grand cities of the Dreamlands, all who worship the Sleeper of N'kai do so under the watchful gaze of onyx and basalt eyes.

And such due dilligance is often rewarded: should Tsathoggua's horrid fury boil to the surface, his statues lash out and smite all those who would dare threaten his fodder.

"	[In] that secret cave in the bowels of Voormithadreth... abides from eldermost eons the god Tsathoggua. You shall know Tsathoggua by his great girth and his batlike furriness and the look of a sleepy black toad which he has eternally. He will rise not from his place, even in the ravening of hunger, but will wait in divine slothfulness for the sacrifice."
