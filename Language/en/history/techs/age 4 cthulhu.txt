Cthulhu, the Great Old One sleeping in the sea, is the most well-known of the eldritch deities. His cultists and statues span the globe, and many have visitations from fragments of his sleeping mind in their own dreams.

He is a mountainous figure, immense and unstoppable, and to look upon him is to go insane. His rise would be apocalyptic, though when R'lyeh sunk beneath the sea, many have been fixed on preventing such a thing.

"Iä! Iä! Cthulhu fhtagn!"
