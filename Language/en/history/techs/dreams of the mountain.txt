Mount Voormithadreth is an extinct volcano, the tallest peak in the Eiglophian range, where Tsathoggua and Atlach-Nacha may be found in the mountain's deepest caverns and where the bestial remnants of the Voormis may be found in its highest caves.

". The glassy scaurs and grim ramparts of Mount Voormithadreth, highest and most formidable of the Eiglophians, had beetled above them, wedging the sun with dark scoriac peaks at mid-afternoon, and walling the blazonries of sunset wholly from view. They had spent the night beneath its lowermost crags, keeping a ceaseless watch, piling dead branches on their fires, and hearing on the grisly heights above them the wild and dog-like ululations of those subhuman savages, the Voormis for which the mountain was named."
