When it comes to hunting, the Romans, like the Greeks, chose to hunt in order to gain sacrifices for the gods and to organize feasts.

It should be noted that the Romans were not as passionate about hunting as the Greeks. They viewed it more as a sport and entertainment that was provided by exercise. Usually, they were hunted on non-working days (otium). They hunted mainly hares, wild boars and birds using the most effective and the simplest methods, including traps and various types of traps. A great example of such an approach is the account of Pliny the Younger from his hunt. In “Letters”, Pliny talks about his hunting trophies and the calm with which he watched the hunt from the viewer’s point of view. As he himself says, “there was neither a javelin nor a spear next to me, but… a stylus and a writing board.” In addition, he advises the addressee to take food, a bottle and something to write on for a similar trip.

The animal that was often hunted was the wild boar, which, according to Pliny the Elder, appeared on the tables of the Romans quite early. It is worth mentioning, however, that the introduction of a new, wild dish to the salons was badly received by various circles, including the extremely conservative Cato the Elder (known as the Censor). During feasts, only the middle part of the wild boar – “wild boar tenderloin” (lumbus aprinus) was served.
