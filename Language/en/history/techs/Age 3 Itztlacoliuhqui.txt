Itztlacoliuhqui is the god of frost, and the former god of the dawn. 
At the creation of the fifth sun, Tonatiuh, the sun god, demanded obedience and sacrifice from all other gods. Enraged at the Sun God’s arrogance, the god of dawn and the planet Venus, Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, shot an arrow at the sun. However, the dart missed its mark, and Tonatiuh threw his own dart back at Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, piercing the Lord of Dawn through the head. At that moment, Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli was transformed into the god of obsidian stone and coldness, Itztlacoliuhqui.
Itztlacoliuhqui's iconography depicts a straw broom in his hand, symbolizing the function of this wintry death deity as the cleaner of the way for new life to emerge thereafter.
