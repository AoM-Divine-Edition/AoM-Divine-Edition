Chalchiuitlicue is a goddess who assists Tlaloc in governing the heavenly realm of Tlalocan, which is believed to be a paradise. She is associated with promoting the growth of crops and safeguarding women and children. According to Aztec beliefs, the children offered as sacrifices to Tlaloc are reborn as Ahaque, powerful beings who have control over the weather in Tlalocan. Chalchiuitlicue takes care of these children in the world beyond.
