According to Aztec mythology, Tezcatlipoca, also known as the "Smoking Mirror," was a powerful and cunning god who often played tricks on other deities. In one famous story, Tezcatlipoca challenged Quetzalcoatl, the god of wisdom and knowledge, to a drinking contest. Tezcatlipoca tricked Quetzalcoatl by giving him a potent pulque, a type of fermented beverage, that made him drunk and disoriented.

While Quetzalcoatl was in this state, Tezcatlipoca revealed his obsidian mirror to him. When Quetzalcoatl looked into the mirror, he saw his own reflection as old and decrepit, which horrified him. Tezcatlipoca then taunted Quetzalcoatl, telling him that he had brought shame upon himself by becoming drunk and losing control.
