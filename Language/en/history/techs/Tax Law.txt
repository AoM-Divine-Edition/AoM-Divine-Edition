The economic operations of the Aztec Empire were governed by a strong system of laws. Tribute and taxation were the main sources of income for the empire. Conquered regions paid tribute to the emperor, while Aztec citizens paid taxes, except for specific groups such as priests, nobles, minors, orphans, invalids, and beggars. Merchants and artisans also paid taxes based on their sales and services. Taxes for barrios were based on the crops they produced. Failure to pay taxes resulted in punishment such as slavery or property confiscation.

Tribute was collected by the Triple Alliance every 80 days, 6 months, or 12 months depending on the type of goods and the distance they had to travel. The tribute items included warrior costumes and shields, tropical feathers, copal incense, paper, foodstuffs, and animal products. Each conquered province had official tribute collectors, called calpixque, who ensured timely payment. Tribute payments were generally reasonable, and increased only when a region failed to meet its obligations. Regions that failed to pay tribute were severely punished.
