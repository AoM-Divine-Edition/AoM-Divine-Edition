The Aztecs made masks that were used as decorations or worn for religious ceremonies or as a symbol of a god. They also made masks to honor the dead, with closed eyes and an open mouth. These were worn by important people after they died or put on display to remember them. Masks were collected from different parts of the Aztec empire as tribute, and were used in worship or displayed in temples.
