It's still amazing to me that the Romans were so accurate with their ballistas despite the fact that their mathematical knowledge was so incredibly poor. I mean, hell, the Greeks knew more about math. Romans just didn't give a damn, they just did shit. Look up the aquaduct slopes sometime, they're incredible.

And all without CALCULUS. Still can't believe it. Aliens man, aliens. Or a time-traveling Isaac Newton.
