Though not requiring any sordid couplings, the process to forge a Living Bow requires perhaps more pain and suffering. Over weeks, a Penguin-Fletched's arm is broken and remade, stretched and bent, until their arms themselves become their bows. They must be fed, clean, and bathed thereafter, and few survive long.

"Penguins, attacked in a body, retaliate savagely with their beaks; and our ears now made certain the existence of a rookery far beyond. Had those others disturbed such a place and aroused murderous pursuit? The obstructions did not suggest it, for penguin beaks against the tough tissues Lake had dissected could hardly account for the terrible damage our approaching glance was beginning to make out. Besides, the huge blind birds we had seen appeared to be singularly peaceful."
