The Ludi Apollinares were solemn games (ludi) held annually by the ancient Romans in honor of the god Apollo. The tradition goes that at the first celebration hereof, they were suddenly invaded by the enemy, and obliged to take to their arms. A cloud of darts and arrows fell upon their enemies, and the Romans soon returned victorious to their sports.

The games were established after inspecting a collection of prophecies, the Carmina Marciana. One of several seers (vates) responsible for these predictions was Marcius. The games were organized in accordance with the Oracles of Marcius, which had predicted the disaster at Cannae (the defeat of the Romans by Hannibal)

The prophecies dictated that the Romans should use Greek ritual to honor Diana and Latona, and that they should help contribute to the costs of the games, according to their means. The Sibylline Books were also consulted and confirmed this prophecy. This occurred at the height of the Second Punic War, when Hannibal was invading northern Italy. As in other times, the games were used to allay the public’s fears and distract them from Hannibal’s invasion.

The games were held in the Circus Maximus, with equestrian games as well as stage performances, including praetextae, a category of Roman drama. Ennius (239–169 BC) had Thyestes performed as part of this festival in 169 BC. The Ludi Apollinares received less funding from the Roman government than other games/festivals such as the Ludi Romani or Ludi Plebeii, because it was shorter and had only one day of races.
