Mictlantecuhtli is the God of the dead and the king of Mictlan, the lowest and northernmost section of the underworld. He rules the underworld with his wife Mictecacihuatl, the lady of the dead.
In Aztec cosmology Mictlan was the least desirable destination for the dead. Those that died of old age, disease and other non-heroic deaths were destinated for Mictlan, where they had to complete a four year journey of the soul, and pass though many perilous obstacles.
According to Aztec legend, the twin gods Quetzalcoatl and Xolotl were sent by the other gods to steal the bones of the previous generation of humans from Mictlantecuhtli. The god of the underworld sought to block Quetzalcoatl's escape with the bones and, although he failed, he forced Quetzalcoatl to drop the bones, which were scattered and broken by the fall. The shattered bones were collected by Quetzalcoatl and carried back to the land of the living, where the gods transformed them into the various races of mortals.
