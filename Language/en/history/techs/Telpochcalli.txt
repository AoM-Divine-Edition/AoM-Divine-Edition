Telpochcalli was an important institution in Aztec society where young men from age 15 received education and training to serve their community and fight in wars. These youth schools were located in every district or calpulli. The daily routine at telpochcalli was demanding and rigorous. The day began with a cold bath, followed by a controlled and extremely frugal meal. The students had to memorize the songs praising their gods and were trained in the use of weapons such as the sling and the macuahuitl. In addition to their studies, the students had other obligations, such as carrying necessary materials to repair the temples and working in the fields to sustain their livelihood. Overall, telpochcalli was a place where Aztec youths were prepared to become responsible members of their society and take on various roles in their communities.
