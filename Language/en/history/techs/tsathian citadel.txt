Tsath is a mystical city, populated by the powerful Men of Tsath and their slaves, the Gyaa-Yothn and Y'm-Bhi. The palace of Tsath is gold-and-copper, and is the most protected building in the city.

"Named after the once-worshipped Tsathoggua, Tsath is the last occupied city in K'n-yan. Looking more like a mountain than a city it is a mass of clustered, upward-thrusting towers adorned with a million golden minarets. Despite its imposing size many of the taller spires have long been abandoned or dismantled in favour of easy-to-maintain shorter buildings. Surrounding the outskirts are the great amphitheatres used for entertainment and drawn out public executions.The gold- and stone-paved roads are thronged with ever present caravans flowing noisily in and out. The maze of streets and ornate avenues that run below the great towers are filled with people and lined with curious carvings on its doorways and windows. High up balustraded plazas and huge tiered terraces gave sweeping veiws of gorge-like streets below."
