Tsathoggua is a Great Old One who takes the form of a toadlike demon, who sleeps deep below mount Voormithadreth. He is ever-hungry, but also incredibly lazy, rarely stirring unless there is something to eat. 

He was worshipped in many dark Atlantian cults -- though it is likely such cults did not last into the modern age, especially under the watchful eye of Kastor. Or, at least, we hope they did not last.

"He was very squat and pot-bellied, his head was more like a monstrous toad than a deity, and his whole body was covered with an imitation of short fur, giving somehow a vague sensation of both the bat and the sloth. His sleepy lids were half-lowered over his globular eyes; the tip of a queer tongue issued from his fat mouth."
