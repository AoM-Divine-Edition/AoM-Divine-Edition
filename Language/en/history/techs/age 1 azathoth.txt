Azathoth is the absolute being of reality as a whole. Though a blind, idiot god, his slumber and his fitful dreaming is the reality in which we reside.  Should this truly omnipotent entity awake, our reality would end, replaced with a waking nightmare of unparallelled destruction.

Every image of Azathoth is different, as everyone sees him differently -- even many Outer Gods cannot truly comprehend what he is. Some say he is a chitenous orb, others claim he is a sentient supermassive black hole, and most simply go mad. 

Those who blaspheme his name shall suffer, both under the yoke of Nyarlathotep and under Azathoth's mighty wroth when he eventually and inevitable awakes. Death shall save none of us, for all that he wishes will happen, and all will suffer incomprehensibly under the heaving weight of his waking mind.

"	[O]utside the ordered universe [is] that amorphous blight of nethermost confusion which blasphemes and bubbles at the center of all infinity—the boundless daemon sultan Azathoth, whose name no lips dare speak aloud, and who gnaws hungrily in inconceivable, unlighted chambers beyond time and space amidst the muffled, maddening beating of vile drums and the thin monotonous whine of accursed flutes."
