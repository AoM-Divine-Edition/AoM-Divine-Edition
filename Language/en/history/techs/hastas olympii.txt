A pilum had a total weight of between 1 and 2.5 kilograms (2 and 5 lb),[citation needed] with the versions produced during the earlier Republic being slightly heavier than those produced in the later Empire.

The weapon had a hard pyramidal tip, but the shank was sometimes made of softer iron. The softness could cause the shank to bend after impact and so render the weapon useless to the enemy. Some believe that the pilum was not meant to bend after impact but that bending came from improper handling/removal of the weapon when it became stuck in an object.[citation needed] If a pilum struck a shield it might embed itself, the bending of the shank would force the enemy to discard his shield as unusable without removing the pilum, which would be time-consuming. Even if the shank did not bend, the pyramidal tip still made it difficult to pull out. However, there were many cases in which the whole shank was hardened, making the pilum more suitable as a close-quarters melee weapon and also making it usable by enemy soldiers.

"Hastas" is a general word for spear.
