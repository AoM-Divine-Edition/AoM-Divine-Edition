Tlaloc creates maelstrom that sucks nearby ships.

One of the ways in which Tlaloc is associated with water is through his connection with whirlpools. Whirlpools are powerful currents that spiral in a circular motion, often found in bodies of water such as rivers, lakes, and oceans. In Aztec mythology, whirlpools were seen as a manifestation of the power of Tlaloc.

 In the times of drought human sacrifices were performed near whirlpools because ancient Aztec's believed that the whirlpools were an entrance into the magical realm of Tlalocan where Tlaloc resided.
