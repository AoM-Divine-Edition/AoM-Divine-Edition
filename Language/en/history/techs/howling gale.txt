The screech of a wendigo has often been called a song, a melody of anguish and a winter's storm.  Many have been stricken with the grief of the wendigo's cry, or learned to enjoy its haunting tones after a time.  But like the frigid winds that slice through cloth and bone, beauty does not signify passivity.

Ithaqua's gales are storms which pick up and fling all units in their paths, hurling them over forests, mountains, and walls.  There is little danger to those in shelter, and miraculous little harm done to those caught in the open, though this may be simply because the lord of wendigos prefers to hunt his prey while it can still run and scream.

"Death-Walker... God of the Winds, you who walk on the wind... adoramus te... adoramus te... adoramus te.... Destroy these faithless ones, you who walk with death, you who pass above the earth, you who have vanquished the sky.... Light gleams from the mosques of Baghdad... stars are born in the Sahara... Lhassa, lost Lhassa, worship, worship, worship the Lord of the Winds."
