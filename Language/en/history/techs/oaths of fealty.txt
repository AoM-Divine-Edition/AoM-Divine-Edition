Those that follow Nyarlathotep follow him into ruin and decay, yet they will still follow blindly, heedless of their own concerns, driven only by his voice and commanding resence. This ritual, born of such oaths, causes all nearby to follow only the word of Nyarlathotep, attacking all who come near.

"And when I, who was colder and more scientific than the rest, mumbled a trembling protest about “imposture” and “static electricity”, Nyarlathotep drave us all out, down the dizzy stairs into the damp, hot, deserted midnight streets. I screamed aloud that I was not afraid; that I never could be afraid; and others screamed with me for solace. We sware to one another that the city was exactly the same, and still alive; and when the electric lights began to fade we cursed the company over and over again, and laughed at the queer faces we made."
