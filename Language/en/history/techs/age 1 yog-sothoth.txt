Yog-Sothoth is an Outer God often described as a mass of orbs and tentacles. He is locked beyond the universe itself, limited to peering into it and occasionally making himself manifest in response to summoning rituals done in his name.

He is truly omniscient, and exists beyond time itself, though is still able to communicate reasonably well, such as when he spoke to Randolph Carter and offered him knowledge and power.

"Yog-Sothoth knows the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the key and guardian of the gate."
