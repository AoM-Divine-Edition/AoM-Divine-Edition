Yig is a Great Old One that either takes the form of a gigantic snake or a strange, semi-humanoid snake man. Unlike most of his kin, Yig is not a malicious deity, though he still is vindictive and vengeful, striking out at those who threaten his children in horrific fashion.

Worshipped by many Native American tribes, Yig had something of a ceasefire between them and him -- they made offerings to him, they left him and his children alone, and in return, he wouldn't rage among them, except during Autumn when he entered a feeding frenzy and could only be kept away by the beating of drums.

"It seems that Yig, the snake-god of the central plains tribes—presumably the primal source of the more southerly Quetzalcoatl or Kukulcan—was an odd, half-anthropomorphic devil of highly arbitrary and capricious nature. He was not wholly evil, and was usually quite well-disposed toward those who gave proper respect to him and his children, the serpents; but in the autumn he became abnormally ravenous, and had to be driven away by means of suitable rites. That was why the tom-toms in the Pawnee, Wichita, and Caddo country pounded ceaselessly week in and week out in August, September, and October; and why the medicine-men made strange noises with rattles and whistles curiously like those of the Aztecs and Mayas."
