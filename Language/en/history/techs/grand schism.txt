Dagon and his offspring hold great sway over the ocean and its depths, and take terrible mirth in the tortures of the hapless souls condemned to them.  Shades of vessels and crews who failed to survive the attentions of the deep dance across the waves, horrifying even those who beckoned the father of the abyss, and though these taken ships are usually returned, none will ever be the same again.

Tales are told of the strange decay in the years following such abductions, of luminous green fungi and haunted crews more fish than man.  

Why kill those who are pulled to the depths, when in a decade they will return of their own accord?  Why keep them forever in the sea as corpses, when they might instead be kin?

"I cannot think of the deep sea without shuddering at the nameless things that may at this very moment be crawling and floundering on its slimy bed, worshipping their ancient stone idols and carving their own detestable likenesses on submarine obelisks of water-soaked granite. I dream of a day when they may rise above the billows to drag down in their reeking talons the remnants of puny, war-exhausted mankind --of a day when the land shall sink, and the dark ocean floor shall ascend amidst universal pandemonium."
