The Aztec calendar was a complex system of tracking time used by the Aztecs and other pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures. It consisted of two interlocking calendars, the tonalpohualli and the xiuhpohualli.

The tonalpohualli was a sacred calendar of 260 days that was used for divination and religious rituals. It consisted of 20 day signs, each with a specific symbol and meaning, and 13 numbers. The combination of a day sign and a number gave each day its unique identity in the calendar. The tonalpohualli was divided into 13-day periods called trecenas, and each trecena was associated with a particular deity or aspect of life.

The xiuhpohualli was a solar calendar of 365 days that was used for agricultural and civic purposes. It was divided into 18 months of 20 days each, with an additional five days at the end of the year known as Nemontemi, which were considered unlucky days. Each month was associated with a particular agricultural activity or festival, and the names of the months were based on the cycles of nature.

The two calendars were interlocking in that every 52 years, the last day of the tonalpohualli coincided with the last day of the xiuhpohualli, creating a "calendar round" or "bundle." This was a significant event in Aztec culture, as it was believed to represent the renewal of the cosmos.

The Aztecs used their calendar to plan religious ceremonies, agricultural activities, and other important events. It was also used to track the birthdays of individuals, which were believed to have a significant impact on their destiny. The calendar was a central aspect of Aztec culture and was closely tied to their religious beliefs and understanding of the natural world.
