Roman archers fought using composite bows, like the horsemen of the Asian steppes. Made from layers of wood, bone, horn, and sinew, they were strong and springy, packing a lot of punch for weapons of their size. Stiffer parts on the ends of the bow and the hand grip gave the string greater leverage and kept the bow from bucking when it was fired, increasing accuracy.

These were much less powerful than the bows that would strike dread into knights in the late Middle Ages. With a draw weight of around 90 lbs, they had half the power of the later English longbow. For the time this was a lot of power.
