The Wichita would make offerings of corn to appease Yig, as only by this appeasement for the original sin in Yig's eyes, the sin of being human, could Yig's tolerance be continued. But for the particularly devoted, Yig would even send his children to their aid, even if said children were as wild as their father.

"Yig was a great god. He was bad medicine. He did not forget things. In the autumn his children were hungry and wild, and Yig was hungry and wild, too. All the tribes made medicine against Yig when the corn harvest came. They gave him some corn, and danced in proper regalia to the sound of whistle, rattle, and drum. They kept the drums pounding to drive Yig away, and called down the aid of Tiráwa, whose children men are, even as the snakes are Yig’s children. It was bad that the squaw of Davis killed the children of Yig. Let Davis say the charms many times when the corn harvest comes. Yig is Yig. Yig is a great god."
