The Yith-Possessed are ordinary soldiers, filled with the spirits of the Great Race of Yith, granting them inhuman strength, particularly in smaller numbers. Against them, heroes and legends falter and fade, the strongest of men finding their works turn to ruin.

"The Great Race's members were immense rugose cones ten feet high, and with head and other organs attached to foot-thick, distensible limbs spreading from the apexes. They spoke by the clicking or scraping of huge paws or claws attached to the end of two of their four limbs, and walked by the expansion and contraction of a viscous layer attached to their vast, ten-foot bases."
