Xoxhiquetzal was a goddess associated with beauty, love, and flowers, serving as a protector of young mothers and a patroness of pregnancy, childbirth, and the crafts practiced by women such as weaving and embroidery.
She resided in the heavenly realm of Tamoanchan, where it was always summer, and the land was covered in flowers. During the creation of humankind, the four creator gods used Xoxhiquetzal's hairs to create the first woman. 
Unlike several other figures in the complex of Aztec female earth deities connected with agricultural and sexual fecundity, Xochiquetzal is always depicted as an alluring and youthful woman, richly attired and symbolically associated with vegetation and in particular flowers.
