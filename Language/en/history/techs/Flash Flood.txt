Chalchiuhtlicue brings the storm clouds to flood an area.

In Aztec Mythology Chalchiuhtlicue was the ruler of the 4th age of the sun, which was known as the Age of The Water, Nahui-Atl (Water Sun)

 Chalchiuhtlicue retaliated against Tlaloc's mistreatment of her by releasing 52 years of rain, causing a giant flood which caused the Fourth Sun to be destroyed. People of this age turned into fish.
