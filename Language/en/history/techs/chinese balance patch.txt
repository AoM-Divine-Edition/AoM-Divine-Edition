Here are all the changes.

Rebirths:

All human soldiers (including fire lancers), myth units, and heroes can be reborn. While the rebirth process is being trained, the unit acts normally. If the unit dies while the rebirth is being trained, the cost is refunded. 

Reborn units have 90% hp, except for heroes, who suffer no penalty.

Peasant: 2 favor, 14 seconds
Scout Cavalry, Halberdier, Chu Ko Nu, Mounted Archer: 5 favor, 30 seconds
