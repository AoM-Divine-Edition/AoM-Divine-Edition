According to Aztec mythology, TlƒÅhuizcalpantecuhtli was a god of dawn, and associated with the planet Venus. According to Aztec creation story, Tonatiuh, the sun god, required obedience and sacrifices from the other gods before he would move. Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, the god of dawn and the planet Venus, became furious with Tonatiuh's arrogance and shot an arrow at the sun. However, Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli missed his target, and Tonatiuh retaliated by throwing his own dart back, piercing Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli through the head. This event transformed Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli into Itztlacoliuhqui, the god of obsidian stone and coldness. The story emphasizes the importance of obedience to Tonatiuh and the consequences of challenging his authority.
