The Aztec chinampas were an innovative system of agriculture used by the Aztecs in ancient Mesoamerica. These were man-made islands or floating gardens built on shallow lake beds around the Valley of Mexico. The word "chinampa" comes from the Nahuatl word "chinamitl," which means "square made of canes" or "reeds."

The chinampas were separated by narrow canals, allowing boats to travel between them to bring crops to market. The canals were also used for irrigation, as the chinampas were watered using a sophisticated system of sluices and channels.
