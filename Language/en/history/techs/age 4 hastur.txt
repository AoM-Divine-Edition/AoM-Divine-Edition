Hastur, more commonly known as the King in Yellow, is a Great Old One with a powerful cult presence. Hastur brings plagues and disease, and is often associated with all infectious corruption, always under his yellow sign.

He also appears in his play, entitled The King in Yellow, a cursed and horrifying production that rapidly degenerates into a maddening and unholy ritual. 

"Along the shore the cloud waves break,
The twin suns sink beneath the lake,
The shadows lengthen
In Carcosa.
Strange is the night where black stars rise,
And strange moons circle through the skies
But stranger still is
Lost Carcosa.
Songs that the Hyades shall sing,
Where flap the tatters of the King,
Must die unheard in
Dim Carcosa.
Song of my soul, my voice is dead;
Die thou, unsung, as tears unshed
Shall dry and die in
Lost Carcosa."
