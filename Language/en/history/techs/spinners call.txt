Atlach-Nacha is a kind and brooding god, who truly cares for its servants. And in such loving embrace, what gifts may be found! Gifts of shining eyes, skuttling limbs, and malodorous fumes emitting from a face filled with fangs dripping black venom.  When the weaver in the shadows calls out, the body contorts, bursting into arachnine forms most pleasing.

Such spiders are fearsome, much stronger than their former selves, though they will fall to heroes and require more space in which to live lest they devour each other instead.

"KREEEEEEEE"
