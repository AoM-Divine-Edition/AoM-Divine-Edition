Klarkash-Ton, known as The Heirophant, was an ancient Atlantean high-priest of the "titan" Zhothaqquah. His grotesque behavior and insatiable lust caused him to become loathed and feared, though few discovered that Zhothaqquah was in fact Tsathoggua, and none lived long knowing this. 

Klarhash-Ton was a reincarnated spirit of the mighty sorcerer Eibon, a truly detestible figure who may still prowl the world today.

"They’ve been inside the earth, too—there are openings which human beings know nothing of—some of them in these very Vermont hills—and great worlds of unknown life down there; blue-litten K’n-yan, red-litten Yoth, and black, lightless N’kai. It’s from N’kai that frightful Tsathoggua came—you know, the amorphous, toad-like god-creature mentioned in the Pnakotic Manuscripts and the Necronomicon and the Commoriom myth-cycle preserved by the Atlantean high-priest Klarkash-Ton."
