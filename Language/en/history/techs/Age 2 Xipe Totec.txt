Xipe Totec, the flayed one was one of the four creator gods alongside Quetzalcoatl, Tezcalipoca, and Huitzilopochtli. He was God of maize, fertility, gold, and the seasons. Xipe Totec wore the skin of a human victim. Skin the represented the maize and the blood dripping from the victim's skin represented the nightly rains.
The sacrificial victims, usually war captives, were skinned in symbolic imitation of the regeneration of plants and seeds which shed their husks and thereby provide new seeds.
Stealing gold was a capital offence and anyone that got caught was skinned alive during the Tlacaxipehualiztli festival.
