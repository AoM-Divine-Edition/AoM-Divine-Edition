Shub-Niggurath is an outer god associated with fertility and unholy biology, particularly plant biology. She delights in transforming her worshippers into terrifying creatures, and gives birth to hundreds of vile Dark Young.

She is very active in this world, for an outer god, and she has cults all across the world, most of which focus on the path towards transformation and becoming one of her many, many servitor races, from satyr-like immortals to tentaclular abominations.

"Yo you can't say that man, not with the hard 'urath' man, that ain't cool man."
