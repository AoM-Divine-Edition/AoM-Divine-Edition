The Yig's spite for those who till the land is bitter indeed, and for those who despise the snakes which are his beloved children, what better punishment than to become the very thing they fear?  

As Yig's curse intensifies, the afflicted will shed their soft skin agonizingly, as their spine elongates and contorts and their limbs are slowly pulled off by the constriction of a thousand worms under the skin.  Once the transformation is complete, one would be forgiven for assuming the wretched thing was never human, if it were not for the human visage, contorted in loathing and fury.  Such abominations are driven to hunt and kill, of course, as it is all too sweet to see a sobbing wretch, devoured whist living by one who had been beloved of them.

"To come to the point, the thing I have is what you might call a victim of Yig’s curse—a physically living victim. We don’t let the bulk of the nurses see it, although most of them know it’s here. There are just two steady old chaps whom I let feed it and clean out its quarters—used to be three, but good old Stevens passed on a few years ago. I suppose I’ll have to break in a new group pretty soon; for the thing doesn’t seem to age or change much, and we old boys can’t last forever. Maybe the ethics of the near future will let us give it a merciful release, but it’s hard to tell."
