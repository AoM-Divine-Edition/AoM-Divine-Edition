Ceres' signs and iconography, like Demeter's from early Mycenae onwards, include poppies - symbolic of fertility, sleep, death and rebirth. Poppies readily grow on soil disturbed by ploughing, as in wheatfields, and bear innumerable tiny seeds. They were raised as a crop by Greek and Roman farmers, partly for their fibrous stems and for the food value of their seeds. Where the poppy capsule alone is shown, this probably belongs to the opium poppy (papaver somniferum, the "sleep-bearing poppy". The Roman poet Vergil, in Georgics, 1.212, describes this as Cereale papaver, or "Ceres' poppy", which eases pain and brings sleep - the deepest sleep of all being death. Poppies are often woven into Ceres' wheat-stalk crown, the corona spicea, worn by her priestesses and devotees.
