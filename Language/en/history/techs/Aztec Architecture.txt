The Aztecs were skilled architects and engineers, and their buildings served both practical and symbolic purposes.

One of the most recognizable features of Aztec architecture is the use of stepped pyramids or temples, which were used for both religious and ceremonial purposes. These structures were usually made of stone and decorated with carvings and sculptures depicting gods, mythological creatures, and important events. The most famous of these pyramids is the Templo Mayor in Tenochtitlan, which was the capital of the Aztec empire.
