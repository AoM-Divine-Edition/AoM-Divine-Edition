Dagon is the Great Old One that is both the father and god of the Deep Ones. Though he is far from a true eldritch deity, he still exerts great influence on the world through his many cults and children. 

His worshippers, usually seafaring folk and fishermen, inevitably become Deep Ones themselves, transformed through immortality-offering tainted meats. The most famous instance of this occurred in Innsmouth. 

"With only a slight churning to mark its rise to the surface, the thing slid into view above the dark waters. Vast, Polyphemus-like, and loathsome, it darted like a stupendous monster of nightmares to the monolith, about which it flung its gigantic scaly arms, the while it bowed its hideous head and gave vent to certain measured sounds."
