Metalworking in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica started later compared to other regions. It was around 600-800 CE when people in West Mexico started creating unique metal works. They learned metallurgical techniques from other regions through trade routes. They used different metals such as copper-silver, copper-arsenic, copper-tin, and copper-arsenic-tin to create objects that fall into three categories: objects for everyday use, personal adornment, and objects used for ceremonies and rituals. The last two categories have more distinct artifacts with metals playing an important role in their sacred and symbolic culture.
