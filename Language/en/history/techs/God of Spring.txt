Xipe Totec was a significant figure representing fertility, warfare, and the transition to manhood for young warriors. During the Tlacaxipeualiztli festival in March, an 'ixiptla' or live image of the god wore a human skin for twenty days. In April, during Tozoztontli Xochimanaloya, the skin was discarded as a symbol of shedding the dry, old skin of the earth in exchange for a new, lush one that the upcoming rains would bring forth.
