All those who serve Cthulhu seek only one thing: the awakening of their lord.  Such a deed would mark the tortured end of humanity, of course -- except for Cthulhu's worshipers, who will enjoy the sweet priviledge of a merciful, swift death.  As the world descends into madness and agony, smile happily in the knowledge that your end will be peaceful.

And so Endbringers sacrifice themselves to the great dreamer, filling their veins with green blood and becoming gods amongst men capable of laying an army low, before their blood burns through their veins.  And if they so choose, and if Cthulhu's blessing rests upon them, they may become a taste of The End, the True End, the Awakening. 

Acid blood pools on the ground, burning green flames reach towards the sky, a blistering fetid vapor lays low those foolish enough to tresspass on the afflicted ground, and all buildings will perish save those under divine protection.  Against even a fraction of The End, only the gods themselves can stand.

Kill all cultists of Cthulhu you see.  Do not let them enter your cities.  Do not tolerate them near your lands.  Destroy their temples, force them back, kill Endbringers the moment they appear, and maybe, just maybe, you will not experience The End.

"Then mankind would have become as the Great Old Ones; free and wild and beyond good and evil, with laws and morals thrown aside and all men shouting and killing and revelling in joy. Then the liberated Old Ones would teach them new ways to shout and kill and revel and enjoy themselves, and all the earth would flame with a holocaust of ecstasy and freedom."

(Chant comes from Mother of Abominations from Cradle of Filth)
