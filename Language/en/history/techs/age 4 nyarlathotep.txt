Nyarlathotep is an Outer God, but unlike all others of his vile kind, he is neither exiled, nor asleep, nor distant. He walks the earth in a thousand forms, often as a tall man, and is the only eldritch deity who may seamlessly pass as a normal human should he so choose.

He is deliberate in his malice and cruelty, spreading madness and ruling groups of men with an iron fist and a commanding tongue. He also serves at the whim of Azathoth, enacting the sleeping god's every fitful desire. 

"And where Nyarlathotep went, rest vanished, for the small hours were rent with the screams of nightmare."
