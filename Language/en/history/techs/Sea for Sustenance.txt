Opochtli was a god of the Aztec pantheon who was considered as one of the representatives of the rain god Tlaloc. Tlaloc was a major deity who was believed to control the rain, thunder, and lightning, and was highly revered in the Aztec religion. As a representative of Tlaloc, Opochtli was associated with the powers of rain, fertility, and abundance. He was also considered as the god of fishing and hunting.

Opochtli was credited with inventing various tools, including the atlatl, the net, the canoe pole, and the bird snare. These tools were important for hunting and fishing, and thus Opochtli became associated with these activities.
