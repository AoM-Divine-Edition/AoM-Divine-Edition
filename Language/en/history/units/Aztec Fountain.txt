The Chapultepec aqueduct was built to provide potable water to Tenochtitlan. This fresh water was transported from the Chapultepec springs.Two aqueducts following the same route from the springs were built by the Aztecs during the 15th century, the first destroyed by flooding and the second by the Spanish.
