Randolph Carter, perhaps the most powerful sorcerer to ever emerge from our species, became almost a god unto himself, a minor eldritch deity perhaps. His later followers never quite retrod his footsteps, though many did arrive closer to their goals than perhaps they would have liked.

"Randolph Carter, who had all his life sought to escape from the tedium and limitations of waking reality in the beckoning vistas of dreams and fabled avenues of other dimensions, disappeared from the sight of man on the seventh of October, 1928, at the age of fifty-four."
