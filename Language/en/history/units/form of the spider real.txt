Daughters of Atlach-Nacha are horrible spiders birthed from the body of their cultist host. They can bury themselves in the ground, before emerging to devour the unwary and the weak.

"Human devootes who bear the mark of a venomous spider bite are particularly revered by the god's cult priestesses, who regard the subject as "favored", and a candidate for transformation by their god. Such candidates may already be initiates, although many are not aware of the spider cult. These unwitting people are either coerced or kidnapped so they may be indoctrinated into the cult. Successfully inducted candidates are later presented to Atlach-Nacha, with the god deciding wether to bless and transform or simply devour the hopefuls."
