An optio, plural optiones (Latin: optio, optiones, from optare, "to choose", so-called because an optio was chosen by a centurion), was a position in a centuria (century) of a Roman army similar to that of an executive officer. The main function of an optio was as an optio centuriae, the second-in-command of a century, although there were many other roles an optio could adopt.

Optiones were vital in the Roman army. An optio was stationed at the rear of the ranks to keep the troops in order. Their duties would include enforcing the orders of the centurion, taking over the centurion's command in battle should the need arise, supervising his subordinates, and a variety of administrative duties.

Optio pay was double the standard legionary pay and they were the most likely men to replace the centurion if the position became vacant.
