The Ahuaque are deities in Aztec mythology who were believed to control rain, thunder, and lightning. They were associated with the element of water and were often depicted as youthful and playful gods. The Aztecs believed that when children were sacrificed to the god Tlaloc, they would be reborn as Ahuaque in Tlalocan, the paradise ruled by Tlaloc. The Ahuaque were believed to have control over the weather and could bring rain to help crops grow. They were also thought to be responsible for floods and other natural disasters caused by water.
