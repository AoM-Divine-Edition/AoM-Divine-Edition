Deep Ones are fishlike humanoids that inhabit sprawling cities at the bottom of the ocean. They primarily worship "Father" Dagon and "Mother" Hydra, though they esteem all eldritch powers of the ocean. 

They commonly make contact with humans, breeding with them and oferring riches and bounties from the sea. Deep One hybrids exhibit several distinctive traits, ranging from bulging eyes to sharp teeth to clawed and webbed hands and feet. Over time, hybrids will almost always become full Deep Ones, feeling a strong pull to the underwater capital of Y'ha-nthlei.

They were alive with a teeming horde of shapes swimming inward toward the town; and even at my vast distance and in my single moment of perception I could tell that the bobbing heads and flailing arms were alien and aberrant in a way scarcely to be expressed or consciously formulated."
