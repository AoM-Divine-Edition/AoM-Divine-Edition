The technology of boats and further improvements in nets, navigation, boat capacity, traps, and so on, that improved the efficiency and production of fishermen were pioneered by the sailors and fishermen of Atlantis. Wall murals show Greek fishermen were taking bluefin tuna in Mycenaean times, a thousand years before the classical Greek age. The Norse were also great sea hunters and fishermen. Salted and dried fish could be stored for many months and was an important source of protein before the days of refrigeration. Many of these techniques were learned from Atlantean colonists in those areas.
