Gyaa-Yothn are mutant hybrids, bred by the Men of Tsath, as a form of slave labor in the place of horses. They are strong and reasonably intelligent for beasts of burden, and though they are usually fairly harmless despite their carnivorous diet, they can be bred for war as well.

"They were great floundering white things, with black fur on their backs, a rudimentary horn in the centre of their foreheads, and an unmistakable trace of human or anthropoid blood in their flat-nosed, bulging-lipped faces."
