The standing army of the Inca was formed primarily by nobles, but the emperor could raise an army of able-bodied men from the general populace at will. Military discipline was strictly enforced when the troops were on the march and at the range of their various projectile weapons. Once they had loosed their missiles they closed in hand-to-hand fighting. The Inca used a wide variety of weapons: wooden sword-shaped clubs, star-headed maces, slings, spears, a sophisticated halberd, and bolas. They wore cotton armor that breathed well, allowed for free movement, and dissipated the force of blows. Bola are a relatively short-ranged weapon consisting of a pair of weights, stone or metal, joined by a chain or rope that entangles itself around the limbs of a target, injuring as it wraps tightly to hamper movement.
