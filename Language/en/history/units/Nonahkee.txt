Iztaccihuatl, also known as "White Woman" in the Nahuatl language, is a legendary figure in Aztec mythology and a dormant volcano located in central Mexico. According to legend, Iztaccihuatl was a beautiful princess who was deeply in love with her warrior lover, Popocatepetl. When Popocatepetl went to battle, the evil Tlaxcaltecas spread rumors that he had died, causing Iztaccihuatl to die of a broken heart. Popocatepetl returned to find his beloved dead and, in his grief, he carried her body to the mountaintop where they both lay down and turned into mountains, becoming forever joined in an eternal embrace. The silhouette of Iztaccihuatl, with its snowy peaks and valleys, is said to resemble a sleeping woman, and it is often referred to as the "Sleeping Lady".
