Humorous, playful, and unpredictable, the coyote was considered sacred to the Aztec as well as many other Native peoples, and the Aztec coyote runner strove to emulate the animal's qualities in battle. Coyote runners wore teeth and fur to symbolize the coyote's physical appearance, coupled with bright colors and feathers to illustrate its capricious nature.

The coyote runners were all left-handed because that made them more dangerous in combat.
