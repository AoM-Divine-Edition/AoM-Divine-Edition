Tzitzimime were tremendous star demons that lived in the darkness. Their ultimate goal was to wait until both humans and gods could not keep the world alive, and then attack and destroy humankind. A special Aztec ceremony called Xiuhmolpilli or ‘The Tying Together of the Years’ was held to help ensure that they continue to exist every 52 years - the length of an Aztec century.

At the end of each century, a ‘New Fire’ ritual took place in which all Aztec hearths but one were extinguished. From the only flame left alight was kindled a new fire that promised a fresh beginning to all. If a fire could not be coaxed into life, dire consequences could ensue: darkness would descend upon the Aztecs and the terrifying Tzitzimime would come to tear apart all mortal beings.

The Tzitzimimeh were also associated with the stars and especially the stars that can be seen around the Sun during a solar eclipse. This was interpreted as the Tzitzimimeh attacking the Sun, thus causing the belief that during a solar eclipse, the tzitzimime would descend to the earth and possess men.
