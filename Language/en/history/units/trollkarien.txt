Trollkarien are dim-witted, man-eating creatures that live in caverns beneath hills and mountains. They are allies of the giants and trolls, and will fight against the gods during Ragnarok. Trollkarien are strong, and have long lifespans, but are not known for their beauty (having the face of a boar). Unlike trolls, trollkarien would not turned to stone in daylight. Some are known to steal women and children, and might leave a changeling in exchange for a kidnapped child. Some trollkarien had magical powers, particularly divination of the future and magically poisoning their arrows.
