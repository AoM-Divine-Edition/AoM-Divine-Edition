Draugr were the undead of Norse mythology. People who were nasty, greedy, or generally unpopular, were most likely to become a draugr. As such, draugr were usually greedy, bloodthirsty, spiteful, and malicious. Although some myths show the draugr as blood-drinking, they are more akin to modern zombies than vampires. They possessed massive strength, could change size at will, but looked and stunk like rotting corpses. They usually stayed in their graves, guarding the treasures they were buried with, but also liked to enter villages and communities to wreak havoc on the living, often on those who wronged them in life. 

Draugr could kill someone by crushing them with their superior strength, eating their flesh, eating them whole while enlarged, or even by driving the victim insane. The draugr were said to be able to enter dreams to torment their victims, always leaving a "gift", to show the victim the encounter was real.

Draugr could be killed, suffering a second death, if their bodies decomposed too much, or if they were burned, dismembered, or destroyed.

Other abilities Draugr were said to have include controlling the weather, seeing the future, being invulnerable to weapons, and sinking into the ground to escape danger. One draugr, named Viga-Hrappr Sumarlithason, was described in the Laxdale Saga to be able to transform into a seal with human-like eyes. Another draugr in Icelandic folktales was said to also turn into a great flayed bull, a grey horse with a broken back (but no ears or tail), and a cat that would sit upon a sleeper's chest and grow steadily heavier until their victim suffocated.
