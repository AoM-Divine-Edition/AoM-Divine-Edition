Shub-Niggurath has an affinity for the moon, particularly the new moon. During such times, a forest of spindly, half-dead trees may be grown in an instant, filled with creeping horrors.

"The moon is dark, and the gods dance in the night; there is terror in the sky, for upon the moon hath sunk an eclipse foretold in no books of men or of earth's gods."
