The gryphon is a legendary creature with the body, tail, and back legs of a lion; the head and wings of an eagle; and sometimes an eagle's talons as its front feet.

Because the lion was traditionally considered the king of the beasts, and the eagle the king of the birds, by the Middle Ages, the gryphon was thought to be an especially powerful and majestic creature. Since classical antiquity, gryphons were known for guarding treasures and priceless possessions. In Greek and Roman texts, gryphons and the one-eyed Arimaspians were associated with gold deposits of Central Asia. Indeed, as Pliny the Elder wrote, "gryphons were said to lay eggs in burrows on the ground and these nests contained gold nuggets."

"But now listen to another and a fearsome spectacle. Beware of the sharp-beaked hounds of Zeus that do not bark, the Gryphons, and the one-eyed Arimaspians, mounted on horses, who dwell about the flood of Pluton's stream that flows with gold. Do not approach them." -Aeschylus, Prometheus Bound 802 ff (Greek tragedy C5th B.C.)
