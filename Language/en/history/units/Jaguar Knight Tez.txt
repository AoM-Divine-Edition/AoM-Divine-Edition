Aztec warriors who had captured at least four enemy soldiers became eligible for the ranks of the eagle knight or the jaguar  knights. Presumably, this emphasis on capturing enemies was to collect a pool of captives for sacrifice, but the Aztec were also known for dealing death in battle, killing with single strokes of their obsidian swords, or hurling barbed spears with atlatls. Their own warriors who caused confusion or disorder in ranks were beaten on the spot and sometimes killed.

The dress of jaguar knights incorporated bright colors and spots to evoke the imagery of a jaguar. The jaguar was a symbol of the night, a prowler and a predator, an appropriate model for an elite warrior. Jaguar knights are usually depicted carrying shields and obsidian swords.
