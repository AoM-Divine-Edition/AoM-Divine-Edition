The Wendigo of Ithaqua, his many wretched children, are entirely different from the spiritual Wendigo of Native American myth. Where those are completely incorporeal, and the bodies they possess are (or more accurately were) entirely human, these Wendigo are full, blood-and-bone creatures, a living species all their own.
There is much confusion between these varieties, as you would expect -- Eldritch Wendigo are more social, larger, and bestial in appearance, though are overall far less dangerous as they can be reasoned with. Among native tribes, they were named "Howling Wendigo" or "Singing Wendigo", as though few realized the true, fundamental difference between the two, the song of the Eldritch Wendigo was utterly unlike anything a "normal" Wendigo could ever hope to produce.

"Do you hear it, over the wind? Those unearthly howls? They're so shrill as to make my ears bleed, but love it I do. More than anything. At first I hated it, same as anyone would, but over the years I've lived here, over the friends and family I've lost to them, oh how I love it. The melodies of their calls, the sorrow, the pain. Felt it I have. Sometimes I feel like joining in, but my voice cracks long before I get near their pitch. Nothing of this world can make those sounds, that much I know. Only them, half man, half god. Native fellow called them demons, said they were evil. Reckon he was right. Still wish I was one, singing to the winds."
