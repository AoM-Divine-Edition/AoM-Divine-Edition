This is a ritual circle for sacrificing the injured or weak. After its construction, garrison a number of human units within, and then pay a small favor cost to begin the ritual. Within a few seconds, they will be sacrificed (painlessly, I am assured) and favor proportional to their number will be granted.

Afterwards, the ritual circle must be nominally resanctified by a cultist.

"Well, my dear, this is farewell. I can't work no more, not since the assault, so I'm gonna pay my keep in service instead. Take care of the young'uns, I hope they'll follow me in my footsteps one day."
