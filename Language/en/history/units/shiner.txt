Shiners are powerful and extremely long-ranged archers, with arrows that glow strangley in the sky and set ships and siege ablaze. However, this ability comes at a cost: in order to combat the blinding glow of their arrows and in order to sight targets much further than any other archer, they fill their eyes with an injected tincture, causing the edges of their vision to become dulled, eventually reducing to just a pinprick of sight, before blindness sets in. As most are in the early stages of this already, their accuracy suffers greatly.

"I once talked with the archers of that queer people, and I asked them why they would condemn themselves such, choosing an occupation that led to blindness in a decade or so. One responded that it was a better death than the Stoneskin's or the Brutal's, and when I asked him what death he spoke of, he said simply that he was told being sacrificed was painless."
