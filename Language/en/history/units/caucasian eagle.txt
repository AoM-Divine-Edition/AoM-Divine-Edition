Scientific name -- Aquila kafkasios
Size -- 8,300 lbs., 35' long, with a 88' wingspan
Diet -- The liver of the Titan Prometheus

The Caucasian eagle was a gigantic eagle sent by Zeus to feed upon the ever-regenerating liver of the Titan Prometheus after he was chained to a peak of the Kaukasos Mountains as punishment for stealing fire from the gods.

The eagle was variously described as a bronze automaton constructed by the god Hephaestus, or as a fell creature spawned by the drakaina Echidna.

When Heracles set out to free Prometheus from his bonds, he felled the eagle with a volley of arrows. Afterwards the Eagle, as well as the Titan and Arrow, were placed all amongst the stars as the constellations Aquila, the Kneeler, and Saggita.
