Of the many forms of Nyarlathotep, few are more terrible than that of the king.  The maddening tentacled creeper, the man with skin as dark as the void, the winged demon at the door, the hooded stranger, none compare to the might of the voice of the lord.

At His voice, men crumble, to be reborn as His most loyal servants.  At His command, men rejoice in wretched acts as their reality collapses.  Destroy His vessel soon, lest his madness of purpose wipe away all you have created.  It is fortunate that his worshipers many never invoke him again. 

"Don't fail to see Nyarlathotep if he comes to Providence. He is horrible - horrible beyond anything you can imagine - but wonderful. He haunts one for hours afterward. I am still shuddering at what he showed."
