The Aztec chinampas were an innovative system of agriculture used by the Aztecs in ancient Mesoamerica. These were man-made islands or floating gardens built on shallow lake beds around the Valley of Mexico. The word "chinampa" comes from the Nahuatl word "chinamitl," which means "square made of canes" or "reeds."

These special farms can be use by Tlaloque villagers to gather gold.
