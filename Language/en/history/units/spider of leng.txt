Spiders of Leng are gigantic spider monstrosities -- the smallest are the size of a pony, the largest would dwarf an elephant. At one point, they ruled the Plateau of Leng, though the Men of Leng drive them back in a great victory and forced them into the dark caverns of the mountains.

"There were scenes of old wars, wherein Leng's almost-humans fought with the bloated purple spiders of the neighbouring vales."
