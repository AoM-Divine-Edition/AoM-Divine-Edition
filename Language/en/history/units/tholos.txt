This magical temple allows you to train spiritual versions of your heroes. These spirits are just as powerful as the normal heroes and can be mass-produced, but only last a small while.

A tholos is an architectural feature that was widely used in the classical world. It is a round structure, usually built upon a couple of steps (a podium), with a ring of columns supporting a domed roof. It differs from a monopteros, a circular colonnade supporting a roof but without any walls, which therefore does not have a cella. It is not to be confused with the tholos tombs (or "beehive tombs") of Late Bronze Age Greece.
