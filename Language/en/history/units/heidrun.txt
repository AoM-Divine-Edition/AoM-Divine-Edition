Heidrun is a goat in Norse mythology who consumes the foliage of the tree Lerathr and produces mead for the einherjar. She is described in the Poetic Edda and Prose Edda.

"Heidrun, the goat
on the hall that stands,
eateth off Lerathr's limbs;
the crocks she fills
with clearest mead,
will that drink not e'er be drained." - The Poetic Edda
