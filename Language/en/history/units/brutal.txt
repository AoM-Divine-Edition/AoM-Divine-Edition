Brutals are powerful counter-infantry. When in training, each is given a single worm which they insert into their ear to become a brain parasite. This parasite dulls their sense of pain and renders them nearly unstoppable in combat against other infantry, but it dooms them to idiocy, mental decline, and eventual death. None live twenty years, and most die far sooner.
