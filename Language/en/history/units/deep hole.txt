The Esoteric Order of Dagon, the principal cult of Insmouth, was founded by Captain Obed Marsh. Each oath furthered the bond between the cultists and the deep, but the first was the most important.

"Nothin’ was to be diff’runt on the aoutside, only we was to keep shy o’ strangers ef we knowed what was good fer us. We all hed to take the Oath o’ Dagon, an’ later on they was secon’ an’ third Oaths that some on us took. Them as ud help special, ud git special rewards—gold an’ sech—No use balkin’, fer they was millions of ‘em daown thar. They’d ruther not start risin’ an’ wipin’ aout humankind, but ef they was gave away an’ forced to, they cud do a lot toward jest that. We didn’t hev them old charms to cut ‘em off like folks in the Saouth Sea did, an’ them Kanakys wudn’t never give away their secrets."
