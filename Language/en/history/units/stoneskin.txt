Stoneskins are infected with an arcane disease which progessively converts the infected's skin into a rough, stone-like carapace. Over time, it hardens and becomes a suit of armor, which can turn away nearly any piercing attack.
Of course, as the disease progresses, the skin cracks and splits, causing deep, weeping wounds that inevitably sour and, though Stoneskins can endure infections of the blood far beyond anything a normal man could, inevitably they will die in agony. 

"He had heard it said that there were three good cures for greyscale: axe and sword and cleaver. Hacking off afflicted parts did sometimes stop the spread of the disease, Tyrion knew, but not always. Many a man had sacrificed one arm or foot, only to find the other going grey. Once that happened, hope was gone."
