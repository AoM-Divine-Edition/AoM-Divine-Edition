Unwravelers are harmless in and of themselves, but these vile constructs were built to scour the earth, and scour they will. They consume food, wood, and gold in staggering quantities, reducing gold mines to naught but dust in minutes, devouring animals by the score, and chewing through entire forests. As they do so, they heal rapidly, meaning that extreme force is needed to kill an Unwraveler once it's stuck in.

"There were more in the mines, of course...eating everything we could use, from the ore veins to our tools. More came in the hills, engulfing trees whole. Some broke into town...my god...they unwrapped their stomachs and set about consuming every sheep and cow and pig we had. They went to the fields and devoured our grain, they went to our barns and devoured our hay and horses, they oozed into our homes and feasted on our pantries, nothing, I say nothing, could stand against them...We burned them, we cut them, we hit them with hammers and staves and axes and all manner of weapons and items, but we could not disodge them. I write this to tell you of our fate. The forests around us are riddled with monstrosities, we daren't go there.

Starvation, inevitable and inexorable, is a better fate."
