Formless Spawn are servitors of Tsathoggua, and perhaps are in fact his offspring in some horrible fashion. They are slimy, amoeboid creatures composed of a living acid, and though they may grow tentacles and mouths when they desire, their most potent weapon is their mere touch. They can split apart or form together, and in this joined state they are far stronger, though still susceptable to being split apart by enough force.

"	At any rate, when the men of K'n-yan went down into N'kai’s black abyss with their great atom-power searchlights they found living things—living things that oozed along stone channels and worshipped onyx and basalt images of Tsathoggua. But they were not toads like Tsathoggua himself. Far worse—they were amorphous lumps of viscous black slime that took temporary shapes for various purposes."
