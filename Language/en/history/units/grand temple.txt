Grand Temples are the pinnacle of the Eldritch culture. Able to train incredibly strong human units, they act as a centerpoint of your empire, and the construction of one in the mythic age can spell doom for even the most well-defended opponent. Penguin-Fletched can hold a hill against all comers, Gaunt-Riders can decimate villagers, and a single Yith-Possessed can, with the proper support, tear down an army.

"And the Grant Temple of Kha'tlanei, as vast as a city and as tall as a mountain, it stood with gates of alabaster gilded with a strange silver-gold."
