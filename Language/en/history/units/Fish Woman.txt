Acihuatl (Fish woman) was a servant of Tezcatlipoca. She served him alongside his two other aquatic servants crocodile woman and Conch shell woman.

In her primary myth, she assists the wind god Ehecatl to steal the music from the house of the sun and bring it down to earth. Acihuatl and the other servants create a magical ladder to bring Ehecatl back down, and introduce music to mankind.
