A travois was a device used to carry heavy loads, particularly in agricultural activities. It consisted of two long poles or beams, usually made of wood, that were attached to a harness or yoke worn by a draft animal, such as a dog or a llama. The poles were then dragged along the ground, with the load suspended between them.

The Aztecs used travois for a variety of tasks, such as carrying firewood, stones, and other materials needed for building and farming. They were also used to transport sick or injured people, as well as goods for trade.

The design of the Aztec travois was simple yet effective, and it allowed the Aztecs to transport heavy loads over long distances with relative ease.
