### Age of Mythology: Divine Edition

This is the largest and most ambitious mod for Age of Mythology in the history of the game, and will one day add a total of 45 new major gods to the game. Currently, the added civilizations are:

- The Eldritch
  - Azathoth
  - Yog-Sothoth
  - Shub-Niggurath
- The Aztecs (First Cosmology)
  - Tezcatlipoca
  - Quetzalcoatl
  - Huitzilopochtli
- The Romans 
  - Jupiter
  - Juno
  - Minerva
  

As the mod is very large, hosting it on Steam Workshop is not practical. As such, users of this mod will need to keep it up-to-date by either pulling changes using git or re-downloading it after every patch.

### Instructions

1. Download the mod folder and place it in the /mods/ folder in your Age of Mythology files. 
2. Subscribe to the following mods on Steam Workshop, and make sure that they are of lower priority than Divine Edition.
  1. AOM Alpha-Beta Content by AL
  2. UMC Ancient Unit Pack
3. Exclude the /injector/ folder in Divine Edition from your antivirus. This is because the injector executable, as it directly edits another program (that being Age of Mythology), will look like a possible virus to most antivirus programs. 
4. Start Age of Mythology.
5. When you get to the main menu screen, run inject.exe from the /injector/ folder. You can do this either via the command line (where it should print out the process number) or by double-clicking. 
6. Proceed to random maps or multiplayer, and have fun! 

### Known Issues/Unfinished Portions/Rough Edges

- The sudden death and nomad maps will not work seamlessly. This is due to how they are set up with the random map generation.
- Lightning and Deathmatch modes are not currently supported. This is partially due to balance reasons, as we have not yet determined how to properly balance the Eldritch in particular. 
- Playing in online games against AI opponents may cause desyncs. This is a rare but well-documented issue and affects many mods. 
- The AI cannot play any of the new gods and, if somehow given a new god, will default to an old one. Moreover, the AI will not react properly to many strategies, such as ignoring Eldritch rituals, not properly quarantining during the use of Plague, and massing counter-infantry against Roman legion units. 
- Many assets, particularly for the Eldritch, are placeholders. As the Eldritch are visually distinct and very much playable, making their assets is considered a low-priority. 
- Picking an unfinished god will default you to Zeus.
- Picking a random god will pick a random god from the first thirty. As nine out of the second fifteen are unfinished, they will default to Zeus. 
- The major god summary pages are incomplete for the Aztecs and Eldritch, and there are issues with the rollover text. We are still trying to find an elegant solution for this.
- The fake techtrees visible in the in-game techtree viewer are unfinished for the Eldritch and Roman gods. This is because making fake techtrees is agonizing and nobody has wanted to do it yet. 
- Many icons, particularly the Aztec icons, are placeholders and are not owned by the Divine Edition modding team.
- Many histories, particualrly the Roman histories, are not yet written.
- The culture-specific music that plays at the start of matches is considered a sound and so is unaffected by adjusting the music volume.
- The UI is almost completely untouched.
- The Roman titan is the Greek titan.
- Some units buildings lack player color.
- For some relatively low-specs systems, there may be a moment of lag when clicking on "Random Map" or "Multiplayer" after playing several successive matches.
- Balance. There _will_ be severe, glaring balance issues. Please inform us of any you identify in the above discord! 
- Broken interactions. Despite our best efforts, there are almost certainly dozens of cross-civilization interactions which either do not work properly or are flagrantly overpowered. Once again, please inform us of any you identify in the above discord.
- The Eldritch navy is just the Greek navy. This is mostly due to Dagon's potency in water maps being relatively unknown at this point.
- When using the editor, you will have to set one of the "old god picked" or "new god X picked" techs for each player at the beginning of the game. This will clear all of their god powers and techs so if you grant any god powers or set any techs I recommend doing this at around 0.1 seconds into the game.
- Also when using the editor, you will see several units with the same name (many of which don't exist) and many techs with the same name (most of which also don't exist). This is because I am lazy, so I have no good excuse.
- This mod will violently conflict with almost any other mods you have active. 
- Using the "LETS GO!  NOW!" cheat at the beginning of the game will result in overlapping music from 1-2 minutes in.
- In multiplayer, with more than six players all playing Eldritch or Japanese, you may experience slightly more lag.
- I have no idea how saved games will react to this mod, try at your own risk.
- To edit hotkeys for many units, you will need to enter the hotkey twice: once to make the hotkey work, once to make it display properly ingame. 
- It is very possible that your units lost counter for the Eldritch will be insanely inaccurate. I haven't tested that fully yet.
- Your favorite unit/favorite myth unit may be incorrect. I thought I got all of the tags correct, but it's possible I missed some.
- Some relics may not properly benefit new units, or may benefit them unfairly. 
- Some buildings have unusual clickboxes, making them slightly annoying to highlight in a pinch.
- Missing, sub-par, or inaccurate unit line and armory upgrade visual changes.
- Overall jank that you will almost certainly experience.
- You will have to run the injector each and every time you want to play the mod. 

IF YOU EXPERIENCE ANY DESYNCS IN ONLINE PLAY, PLEASE RECORD THE EXACT SCENARIO AND INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM AT ONCE

### Join Our Team!
If you're a modder, especially with modeling/animation experience, we would love to have you on our team! If there's a civilization that you really want in the game, then join us and make the assets for it! That's exactly how we got the Romans, who were never originally part of the plan. 

There are currently two open spaces (each with three major gods) so if you've ever wanted to see the Hindus, Slavs, Yoruba, Polynesians, or anyone else, then sign up quick and make your dream a reality!
